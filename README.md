### Hi There 👋

#### AIGC (C=Code&Content) is All You Need

#### Working at 🌟

- AI4SE & SE4AI **->** Code&Coding Intelligence **->** **LLM** for/as developer teams!
- Software Engineering **->** Program&Code Analysis **->** Collaborative SE!
- Human Computer Interaction **->** Developer-elegant Interaction&Feedback design!

#### Projects 🔭 
- **[AI Coding in Live]**: A collection of ideas totally implemented by AI. Let's see how far it can go.
- **[Code2Graph]**: A converter from source code to graph format that is `language-agnostic` and `extensible`.
- **[SoManyConflicts]**: A VSCode extension to resolve multiple merge conflicts `systematically` and `interactively`.
- **[SmartCommit]**: An assistant for cohesive and conventional commits based on `code-change-graph partitioning`.
- **[IntelliMerge]**: A refined merging tool for Java: `graph-based`, `refactoring-aware`, and `semi-structured`.
- **[CrowdJigsaw]**: A framework for collective problem solving (e.g., knowledge graph building): `collaboratively`.
